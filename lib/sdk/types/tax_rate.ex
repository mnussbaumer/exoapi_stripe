  **description**: Tax rates can be applied to [invoices](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/tax-rates), [subscriptions](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/taxes) and [Checkout Sessions](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout/set-up-a-subscription#tax-rates) to collect tax.

  **:livemode** :: *:boolean*

  Has the value `true` if the object exists in live mode or the value `false` if the object exists in test mode.


  **:metadata** :: *:map*
