  **:currency** :: *:string*

  Three-letter [ISO code for currency](https://stripe.com/docs/payouts). Only applicable on accounts (not customers or recipients). The card can be used as a transfer destination for funds in this currency.


  **:customer** :: *ExOAPI.Stripe.Schemas.DeletedCustomer | ExOAPI.Stripe.Schemas.Customer | :string*

Checks are typically performed when attaching a card to a Customer object, or when creating a charge. For more details, see [Check if a card is valid without a charge](https://support.stripe.com/questions/check-if-a-card-is-valid-without-a-charge).


  **:default_for_currency** :: *:boolean*

  **:fingerprint** :: *:string*

  Uniquely identifies this particular card number. You can use this attribute to check whether two customers whoâ€™ve signed up with you are using the same card number, for example. For payment methods that tokenize card information (Apple Pay, Google Pay), the tokenized number might be provided instead of the underlying card number.

  *Starting May 1, 2021, card fingerprint in India for Connect will change to allow two fingerprints for the same card --- one for India and one for the rest of the world.*


  **:funding** :: *:string*

  Card funding type. Can be `credit`, `debit`, `prepaid`, or `unknown`.

  **:last4** :: *:string*

  The last four digits of the card.


  **:metadata** :: *:map*

  **:tokenization_method** :: *:string*

  If the card number is tokenized, this is the method that was used. Can be `android_pay` (includes Google Pay), `apple_pay`, `masterpass`, `visa_checkout`, or null.
